The technological heart of Nam is **Sibilla**. The name refers to the Sibillini Mountains, a cornerstone of the project's territorial and cultural context. In this digital role, Sibilla accompanies the user through the village, acting as a bridge between Matelica's historical memory and the modern visitor.

### Main Characteristics:

- **Exploration Guide:** Immediate answers regarding historical timelines, architecture, and local food and wine heritage.
- **Natural Language Interaction:** An assistance system configured to provide precise information and suggestions based on real-time needs.
- **Cultural Orientation:** Guided storytelling designed to create a common thread between different historical sites and local traditions.

> [!TIP]
> _Interaction example: "Sibilla, recommend an itinerary that combines the remains of Roman Matelica with the excellence of Verdicchio wine."_

## Local Configuration and Deployment

The **Nam** client is built using the **Vite** environment and requires **Node.js** to run.

Launch in dev mode:

```bash
 npm install
 npm run dev
```

### Usage via Orchestrator (Recommended)

To ensure correct integration with the various system components (Backend, services, database, and app) and to fully leverage all features, the application should be started via the project orchestrator.
